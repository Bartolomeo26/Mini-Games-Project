# About project

Simple website testing both user's memory and knowledge. It allows for them to sign in and then log in in order to save the results.
The site offers 4 games - three of them based purely on memory whereas one of them is strictly related to geographical knowledge.


# Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.
```bash
https://github.com/Bartolomeo26/Mini-Games-Project.git
```
```bash
npm install
```

# Using the application
After installing all the dependencies, the next step is to run the local database (MongoDB) and then start the application with two simple commands.
```bash
mongo
```
```bash
nodemon app.js
```

The very first thing that the user sees is the home page presenting 4 tiles, each related to different mini-game. The navbar at the top of the website has two options in the top right corner - sign in and then log in which allow anyone to have the possibility to save the results after every game.

The website offers four games, each testing different skills related to memory and geographical knowledge. The descriptions of them and the screens presenting the course of the games are as follows.

Country Game - user is supposed to guess which country it is based on the clues from the previous types!

Simon Says - user has to remember an increasingly long pattern of signs shown on the tiles (there are 9 of them). After the sequence has been displayed, user has to repeat it perfectly!
