Simple website testing both user's memory and knowledge. It allows for them to sign in and then log in in order to save the results.
The site offers 4 games - three of them based purely on memory whereas one of them is strictly related to geographical knowledge.
Country Game - user is supposed to guess which country it is based on the clues from the previous types!
Word Game - user has to keep in mind as many words as possible in order to choose if the displayed word is new or has been seen before!
Number Sequence - user needs to remember increasingly long numbers and type them after specific time!
Simon Says - user has to remember an increasingly long pattern of signs shown on the tiles (there are 9 of them). After the sequence has been displayed, user has to repeat it perfectly!
